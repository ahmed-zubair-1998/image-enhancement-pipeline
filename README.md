- Create a folder named `datasets` having sub folders containing the datasets.

.gitignore
CMakeLists.txt
Dockerfile
main.cpp
README.md
run.sh
datasets/
|___DICM/
|___DS/
|___MEF/
|___NPE/
|___NPE-ex1/
|___NPE-ex2/
|___NPE-ex3/
|___VV/
results/
|___datasets
    |___DICM/
    |___DS/
    |___MEF/
    |___NPE/
    |___NPE-ex1/
